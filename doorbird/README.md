Uninstall the distribution version of the binding.

Download the *org.openhab.binding.doorbird-2.5.2-SNAPSHOT.jar* jar file and place it in the addons directory.

Put the binding in DEBUG mode to get a better idea what's happening. Post relevant log file entries to the forum thread.

You also might need to try TRACE mode, but only if there's a problem we can't track down using DEBUG mode.
